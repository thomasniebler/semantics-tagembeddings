# semantics-tagembeddings

In this repository, we make several embedding vector sets publicly available which have been trained as described in [Learning Word Embeddings from Tagging Data: A Methodological Comparison](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1917/paper32.pdf), which is a joint work of [Thomas Niebler](https://www.thomas-niebler.de), Luzian Hahn and [Andreas Hotho](http://dmir.org/staff/hotho) from the [Data Mining and Information Retrieval Group](https://dmir.uni-wuerzburg.de) at the University of Wuerzburg.
